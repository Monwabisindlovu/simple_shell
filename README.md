#The Gates of Shell - Simple Shell Project #Welcome 
#Welcome to "The Gates of Shell" project, a collaboration between Monwabisi Ndlovu and Wandile Maseko.

#Key Guidelines #Learning Focus: Prioritize understanding over shortcuts. Write code from scratch after comprehension. 
#Teamwork: Both partners share GitHub commits. Understand every line of code and communicate effectively.
#Plagiarism Warning: Avoid copying solutions or sharing resources. Cheating will result in zero scores for both partners. 
#Coding Style: Follow Betty style guidelines and avoid memory leaks.
#Project Scope: Implement built-in commands, logical operators, separators, aliases, and variable replacement. 
#Learning Goals: Develop Unix shell concepts, C language skills, and effective learning strategies. #Project Goals #Implement a functional shell that executes commands. #Apply Unix shell concepts and history. #Handle built-in commands and logical operators. #Develop teamwork and collaboration skills. #Embrace learning and avoid plagiarism. #Resources #Unix shell concepts. #Thompson shell inspiration. #3Ken Thompson's contributions. #Starting guide for your shell. #Collaboration #Collaborate on GitHub with Monwabisi Ndlovu and Wandile Maseko. Both partners must contribute and understand the codebase. #Focus on learning rather than copying solutions.

#Remember, at ALX SE, learning to build is the priority. Enjoy creating your Simple Shell and learn along the way!

#Best regards, #Monwabisi and Wandile
