Simple Shell Project - 0x16
Welcome to the README for the Simple Shell project (0x16)!

Overview
This project involves creating a simple UNIX command interpreter, commonly known as a shell. The purpose of this shell is to read commands from the user, interpret them, and execute the corresponding programs or commands. The project aims to reinforce your understanding of various programming and engineering concepts, as well as teamwork and learning strategies.
